This code is based on http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.

## What is this?
I just needed to hammer some code out as I read up on neural networks and deep learning.

## Why is it here?
So that it's harder to lose. And who knows, maybe someone else will find it useful some day.

## Why is it in C#?
It's the language I'm most familiar with. Easier to learn one thing at a time.

## Why aren't you using a library for the math?
The purpose of the exercise was to really get my hands into the engine. Feel the gears. Doing the linear algebra steps myself was part of that.

## MNIST
To run this you'll need to download the MNIST database. There are a number of mirrors you can find. [This is the one I used](https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist).
