This code is based on http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com.

The MNIST data comes from https://github.com/cvdfoundation/mnist.

## What is this?
I just needed to hammer some code out as I read up on neural networks and deep learning.

## Why is it here?
So that it's harder to lose. And who knows, maybe someone else will find it useful some day.

## Why is it in C#?
It's the language I'm most familiar with. Easier to learn one thing at a time.

## Why aren't you using a library for the math?
The purpose of the exercise was to really get my hands into the engine. Feel the gears. Linear algebra is a huge part of that. A library would have made it too easy to forget what was happening underneath.
